we are using melodic which does not have catkin_make, so we need to be cleverer

we will use catkin_tools to do it,
so first install catkin_tools

$ sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools

then we need to configure the workspace we created with

$ catkin config --extend /opt/ros/melodic/

you can check it. it should not have errors here. From now on it is like catkin_make. we do:

$ catkin build

It should also work without issues.

Now we test it without

$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch dockerlauncher dockerlauncher
